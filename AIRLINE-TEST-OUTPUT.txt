Welcome to the AirLine app! This app will assign seats on the airline's
plane with a capacity of 10 seats based on your inputs. At the start of
the program the initial seating chart will be displayed with false values
representing available seats and true values representing occupied seats.

You will be prompted to either enter a 1 to assign a seat in first class,
a 2 to assign a seat in economy class, or a 3 to exit the program if the
plane needs to stay on schedule and depart without being full. After every
seat assignment the new seating chart will be output back to you.

If the first class or economy sections are full you will be prompted to ask
the customer if it is acceptable to assign them a seat in the opposite class.
If so, a seat in the respective class will be assigned. If no, a statement
saying when the next flight departs will be output and the program will
continue running to account for following customers.

When all seats are occupied the program will output a statement of when
the next flight departs and the program exits.

Welcome to the AirLine app! This app will assign seats on the airline's
plane with a capacity of 10 seats based on your inputs. At the start of
the program the initial seating chart will be displayed with false values
representing available seats and true values representing occupied seats.

You will be prompted to either enter a 1 to assign a seat in first class,
a 2 to assign a seat in economy class, or a 3 to exit the program if the
plane needs to stay on schedule and depart without being full. After every
seat assignment the new seating chart will be output back to you.

If the first class or economy sections are full you will be prompted to ask
the customer if it is acceptable to assign them a seat in the opposite class.
If so, a seat in the respective class will be assigned. If no, a statement
saying when the next flight departs will be output and the program will
continue running to account for following customers.

When all seats are occupied the program will output a statement of when
the next flight departs and the program exits.
